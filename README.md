# Carbon Monitor

Automated PR review agent for the `carbon-design-system/carbon` monorepo. Carbon Monitor fetches open, unreviewed pull requests, runs them through Bob (IBM's AI CLI agent), and posts structured review comments directly on the PR — including inline comments on specific diff lines and a summary comment with a final recommendation.

Carbon-specific claims (component props, tokens, icons, accessibility patterns) are verified at review time using the Carbon MCP server before they appear in any posted finding.

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetch** — Queries GitHub for open PRs and excludes: drafts, PRs older than 21 days (configurable), PRs already labelled `AIReviewed`, and bot-authored PRs (Dependabot, Renovate, etc.). Up to 5 PRs are reviewed per run (configurable).

2. **Bundle** — For each PR, builds a temporary workspace under `/private/tmp` containing:
   - `PR_REVIEW_REQUEST.md` — PR description, changed files list, and full unified diff in one file
   - `pr.json` / `files.json` / `diff.patch` — raw metadata
   - `.bob/rules/01-output.md` — agent behavioural rules injected into Bob's context
   - `.bob/skills/carbon-builder/` — Carbon Builder skill copied from the local workspace so Bob can load it inside the bundle directory

3. **Review** — Runs Bob in advanced mode (`bob -p <prompt> --yolo --chat-mode advanced --allowed-mcp-server-names carbon-mcp`) against the bundle directory. Bob works through a structured protocol:
   - **Step 1** — Reads `PR_REVIEW_REQUEST.md` and writes a visible catalogue of every suspicious item per file, classified as Category 1 (Carbon API — requires MCP) or Category 2 (generic — diff-visible).
   - **Step 2** — Resolves every pending catalogue item. Category 1 items are verified using the Carbon Builder skill and Carbon MCP tools (`code_search`, `docs_search`, `get_charts`). Category 2 items are resolved from the diff alone.
   - **Step 3** — Compiles the confirmed findings list with severity (`blocking`, `major`, `minor`, `nit`).
   - **Step 4** — Outputs a structured JSON block between `BEGIN_REVIEW_JSON` / `END_REVIEW_JSON` markers.

4. **Parse** — `reviewParser.js` extracts the JSON, validates it, detects truncation or collapsed-thinking runs, and computes a recommendation (`consider-revising`, `suggested-improvements`, or `looks-good`) from the finding severities.

5. **Post** — Findings that map to a line in the diff are posted as inline GitHub review comments. Remaining findings and the overall summary are posted as a PR issue comment. The `AIReviewed` label is added to the PR.

6. **Cleanup** — The temporary bundle directory is deleted (or kept if `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_KEEP_ARTIFACTS=true`).

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
2. **GitHub token** with `repo` and `write:discussion` scopes
3. **Bob Shell CLI** installed and on `PATH`
4. **Carbon MCP** configured globally in Bob as a streamable-HTTP connection (see setup below)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Carbon-Monitor.git
cd Carbon-Monitor
npm install
```

---

## Configuration

### 1. Environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Required
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here
BOBSHELL_API_KEY=your_bob_api_key_here

# Defaults shown — override as needed
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_OWNER=carbon-design-system
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_REPO=carbon
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_CLI=bob
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_MAX_PRS=5
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_DAYS_BACK=21
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_MAX_DIFF_CHARS=120000
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_REVIEW_LABEL=AIReviewed
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_POST_INLINE_COMMENTS=true
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_POST_SUMMARY_COMMENT=true
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_KEEP_ARTIFACTS=false
```

Full variable reference:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_TOKEN` | ✅ | — | GitHub personal access token |
| `BOBSHELL_API_KEY` | ✅ | — | Bob Shell API key |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_OWNER` | ❌ | `carbon-design-system` | Repository owner |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_REPO` | ❌ | `carbon` | Repository name |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_CLI` | ❌ | `bob` | Agent to use — only `bob` is supported |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_MAX_PRS` | ❌ | `5` | Max PRs reviewed per run |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_DAYS_BACK` | ❌ | `21` | How far back to look for PRs (days) |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_MAX_DIFF_CHARS` | ❌ | `120000` | Diff truncation limit |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_REVIEW_LABEL` | ❌ | `AIReviewed` | Label added after review |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_POST_INLINE_COMMENTS` | ❌ | `true` | Post inline diff comments |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_POST_SUMMARY_COMMENT` | ❌ | `true` | Post summary issue comment |
| `GITHUB_AI_AGENT_KEEP_ARTIFACTS` | ❌ | `false` | Keep temp bundle directory for debugging |

### 2. Bob Shell

Install Bob Shell and trust the directories it needs for MCP tool access:

```bash
npm install -g bobshell
bob --version

bob trust /private/tmp
bob trust /path/to/Carbon-Monitor
```

### 3. Carbon MCP (streamable HTTP)

Carbon Monitor uses Carbon MCP over streamable HTTP, not `npx carbon-mcp`. Create `~/.bob/settings/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "carbon-mcp": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.carbondesignsystem.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_IBM_JWT_TOKEN",
        "X-MCP-Session": "YOUR_SESSION_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verify it is connected:

```bash
bob mcp list
# Expected: ✓ carbon-mcp (streamable-http) - Connected
```

> **Note:** IBM JWT tokens expire. The API server (see below) is being built to automate token refresh so the MCP connection stays valid when running in the cloud.

---

## Running

### One-off review run

```bash
npm start
# or
node src/index.js
```

### Tests

```bash
npm test                # agent integration test
npm run test:parser     # reviewParser unit tests
npm run test:diff       # diffMapper unit tests
npm run test:all        # parser + diffMapper
```

### API server (in development)

```bash
npm run api
```

Starts a lightweight HTTP server on port 3000 (configurable via `API_PORT`). Intended for cloud deployments where the process runs continuously and needs a way to receive token refreshes without a restart.

Endpoints (all except `/api/health` require `Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET>`):

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check — no auth required |
| `GET` | `/api/config` | Current configuration (sanitised) |
| `GET` | `/api/mcp/status` | Carbon MCP connection status |
| `POST` | `/api/mcp/refresh` | Push a new IBM JWT token into Bob's MCP config |
| `POST` | `/api/review/trigger` | Manually trigger a review run |

Configure the API server in `.env`:

```bash
API_PORT=3000
API_SECRET=your_secure_api_secret_here
API_ENABLE_AUTH=true
```

---

## Output Format

Each reviewed PR receives two types of comments:

### Inline comments (on specific diff lines)

```
**Missing aria-label on time picker select**

> [blocking] Should be resolved before this ships.

<cds-time-picker-select> added in this diff has no aria-label attribute.
Interactive select elements inside a composite component must have an
accessible label. Add aria-label="Time zone" (or equivalent) to the element.

*✓ Verified with Carbon Builder + MCP*
```

### Summary comment (PR issue comment)

```

### Recommendation values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Consider Revising` | One or more `blocking` findings, or two or more `major` findings |
| `Suggested Improvements` | Any `major` or `minor` finding, or review reliability was uncertain |
| `Looks Good` | `nit`-level findings only, or no findings |

### Finding severities

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `blocking` | Breaks user-facing behaviour or violates an accessibility requirement |
| `major` | Likely to cause a visible rendering difference or runtime error |
| `minor` | Maintainability risk or subtle behaviour difference — not immediately breaking |
| `nit` | Convention / hygiene — no functional consequence |

---

## Review Reliability

The parser checks for two signals in the agent's output before the JSON block:

- **Catalogue present** — at least one `[file:line] — ... — pending`, `NO-FINDINGS`, or `SKIP` line must appear. If absent, the agent skipped Step 1 and the review is flagged as unreliable (`catalogueWarning` is set in the comment).
- **Step 2 visible** — pending catalogue items must be resolved with `confirmed finding` or `discarded: [reason]` lines in the visible response. If pending items appear but no resolutions do, the run is treated the same as a missing catalogue.

An unreliable run still posts a comment but sets the recommendation to `Suggested Improvements` and includes a prominent warning note.

---

## Deployment

Carbon Monitor is designed to run as a scheduled job in the cloud. The intended setup is:

1. Deploy the Node process to a cloud environment.
2. Run `npm start` on a schedule (cron or a scheduler service) — e.g. daily at 03:00.
3. Use the API server (`npm run api`) alongside it to accept token refresh requests without restarting the process.

The CI/CD safety check in `index.js` skips execution when `TRAVIS_BRANCH` is set to anything other than `main`, preventing accidental reviews from feature branch CI runs.

### Docker

```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose up -d

# Or without Compose
docker build -t carbon-monitor .
docker run -d --name carbon-monitor --env-file .env carbon-monitor

# Logs
docker-compose logs -f
# or
docker logs -f carbon-monitor
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bob not found in PATH
```bash
npm install -g bobshell
which bob
```

### Carbon MCP not connected
```bash
bob mcp list
# Should show: ✓ carbon-mcp (streamable-http) - Connected
# If not connected, check ~/.bob/settings/mcp.json and verify your JWT token is valid
```

### IBM JWT token expired
The Carbon MCP connection uses an IBM JWT that expires periodically. While running on IBM network/VPN:
1. Obtain a fresh token
2. Update `~/.bob/settings/mcp.json` with the new token, or call `POST /api/mcp/refresh` if the API server is running

### Bob requires IBM network
Bob Shell requires IBM office network or VPN access. If you're seeing Cloudflare errors, connect to IBM VPN and retry.

### No PRs to review
This is expected when all open PRs already have the `AIReviewed` label, or no PRs were opened within the `DAYS_BACK` window.

### Keep artifacts for debugging
```bash
GITHUB_AI_AGENT_KEEP_ARTIFACTS=true npm start
```
The bundle directory path is printed to the console. It contains `agent-output.txt` (Bob's full response) and `agent-stderr.txt`.

---

## Development

### Adding review rubric checks

The review prompt in [`src/reviewPrompt.js`](src/reviewPrompt.js) (`buildReviewPrompt`) contains the full 15-check rubric Bob follows. Adding a new check means appending a numbered rule to the prompt — no other files need to change.

### Changing the comment format

Summary comment rendering is in [`formatSummaryComment`](src/reviewPrompt.js) and inline comment rendering in [`formatInlineComment`](src/reviewPrompt.js).

### Adjusting finding filters

`reviewParser.js` contains `filterUnverifiedCarbonFindings` and `computeRecommendation`. The recommendation logic is in `computeRecommendation` starting at line 681.
